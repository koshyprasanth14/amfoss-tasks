I began by opening a Linux terminal and navigating to the root directory where the files were located.
I used a combination of Linux commands such as cd, ls, find, pwd to explore the directory structure, search for files, and identify the target Python script.
Once I located the Python script, I executed it by running the python3 command followed by the script's filename.
The Python script executed successfully, generating Bash code as its output. I ensured that the output was captured, either by redirecting it to a file or storing it in a variable.
After executing the Python script, I diligently extracted the Bash code that it had generated. This involved examining the redirected output file or opening it in a text editor.
In the final step, I encountered encoded or obfuscated Bash code within the extracted content.
I applied my knowledge of Linux terminal commands by employing the appropriate decoding method based on the encoding used. For example, if it was base64 encoded, I used the base64 --decode command.
I would say that this task was really easy.
