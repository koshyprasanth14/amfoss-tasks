#starting the task

I began by opening a Linux terminal and navigating to the root directory where the files were located.
I used a combination of Linux commands such as cd, ls, find, pwd to explore the directory structure, search for files, and identify the target Python script.
**cd (Change Directory):**
Used to change the current working directory.
I navigated to the root directory where the target files were located by using the cd command followed by the path to the root directory.

**ls (List):**
Lists the files and directories in the current directory.
I employed this command to view the contents of directories and identify files of interest.

**find:**
A versatile command to search for files and directories within a directory hierarchy.
I used it to search for specific files, possibly the Python script, within the directory structure.

**pwd (Print Working Directory):**
The pwd command was useful for confirming my current location in the directory structure.
It displayed the absolute path of the current working directory.

#executing the python files and getting the encoded keys

Once I located the Python script, I executed it by running the python3 command followed by the script's filename.

**python3:**

To execute the Python script, I ran the python3 command followed by the script's filename.
This allowed me to initiate the Python script and generate Bash code as output.


The Python script executed successfully, generating Bash code as its output. I ensured that the output was captured, either by redirecting it to a file or storing it in a variable.
After executing the Python script, I diligently extracted the Bash code that it had generated. This involved examining the redirected output file or opening it in a text editor.
In the final step, I encountered encoded or obfuscated Bash code within the extracted content.
I applied my knowledge of Linux terminal commands by employing the appropriate decoding method based on the encoding used. I used the base64 --decode command.

**base64 --decode**
Base64 --decode is a Linux command-line utility used for decoding data that has been encoded in base64 encoding.
Base64 encoding is commonly used to represent binary data as ASCII text, making it portable and easy to share.


I would say that this task was really easy.
