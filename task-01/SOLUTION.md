First i used git clone to clone the repository terminal wizard into my pc. then i used commands cd, cd <filename>, cd ..  to change directories. i used ls to look into folders. command cat was used to open txt and other text files, while a prefix python3 was used before python files. i used google to get the solutions for the gk questions. since i was new to coding i learnt all the required codes from youtube. overall i would say that it was really easy.
