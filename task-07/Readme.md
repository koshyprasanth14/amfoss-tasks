I spent a lot of time trying to style the extension while my api code didnt 
work, and only later i realised that my js code doesnt work as it had many 
errors. I started from scrtch again, correcting all the mistkes taking help 
from chatgpt and youtube. i could style my extension more, and learnt how 
putting a wrong bracket can take hours off your worktime:')
