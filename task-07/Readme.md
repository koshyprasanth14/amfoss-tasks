I embarked on a journey to create a Chrome extension that provides real-time weather details for any city input by the user. This project involved integrating a weather API using JavaScript and changing images based on the weather conditions, displaying humidity, emperature and wind speed. Along the way, I faced challenges and learned valuable lessons about debugging and styling.

**Challenges and Learnings:**

1. Styling Struggles: Initially, I focused a lot on styling the extension without realizing my JavaScript code had errors. This taught me the importance of prioritizing functionality over design.

2. Debugging Marathon: I encountered numerous issues in my JavaScript code. Spending hours debugging, I realized how a single misplaced bracket can cost valuable time. I learned to be careful in code writing and debugging.

3. Starting Afresh: When my code seemed irreparable, I took a step back, corrected my mistakes, and started from scratch. This decision led to a more functional extension.


**Features:**

1. City Input: Users can input any city name to get weather details.
2. Weather Details: The extension provides current weather conditions like temperature, humidity, and description.
3. Dynamic Images: Images change based on the weather (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy).
4. Error Handling: When an invalid city is entered, the extension displays an error message.
