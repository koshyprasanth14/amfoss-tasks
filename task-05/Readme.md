For this project, I was tasked with designing a website for a fictional rock band. Although it wasn't for a real band, it allowed me to apply my HTML and CSS skills while learning to overcome various challenges.

# Design Challenges

**Repetitive Code**

One of the primary challenges I encountered was the repetition of code. As I hadn't yet delved into JavaScript, I had to rely heavily on copying and pasting code for similar elements on the website. This made the codebase less efficient and harder to maintain.

**Image Placement**

Another significant hurdle was the proper placement of numerous images. Creating visually appealing layouts while ensuring the images aligned correctly was a time-consuming task.

# Key features

Here are some of the key features I incorporated into the rock band website:

        Responsive Design: Ensured that the website looked great on various devices and screen sizes.
        Image Galleries: Created visually appealing image galleries for band photos and concert posters.


This was a valuable learning experience for me. I honed my HTML and CSS skills, improved my understanding of code efficiency, and gained valuable insights into the challenges of web design.
