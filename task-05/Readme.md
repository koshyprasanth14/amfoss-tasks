I have made a website for the Rockband inside 'html website'. I used google and youtube to learn html and css. 
i couldnt call it a really difficult task, but i faced many problems, and my codes were too inefficient. having a lot 
of images to place was one of the biggest struggles.  I changed the codes a lot, and im sure that theres a lot
of improvement i have to make.
Creating this website was a great experience for me. I had to learn html and css from scratch, but yeah i was 
ready to learn all whatever i hadnt when i applied for this club.
