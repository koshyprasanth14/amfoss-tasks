I originally intended to install Ubuntu because of its popularity and community support.

After ensuring that my PC met the system requirements, I created a bootable USB drive with the latest Ubuntu ISO.

I booted from the USB drive and began the Ubuntu installation process.

During installation, I chose to install Ubuntu alongside my existing operating system.

However, after installation, I encountered an issue where my PC wouldn't shut down properly, the shutdown process would hang or take a long time.

I researched online and tried various troubleshooting steps, but the shutdown issue persisted.

Frustrated, I decided to consider an alternative Linux distribution and chose Linux Mint due to its reputation for stability.

I downloaded the Linux Mint ISO file and used the same bootable USB drive I had created earlier for Ubuntu.

I booted from the USB drive and followed the Linux Mint installation process.

Linux Mint installed without any issues, and I noticed that my PC now shut down properly.

I transferred my files and data from the previous Ubuntu installation to Linux Mint.

I've been using Linux Mint without any shutdown problems since then.

This version provides a simplified overview of the installation process and the transition from Ubuntu to Linux Mint.
