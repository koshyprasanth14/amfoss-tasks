i had an idea on the logic to obtain the prime numbers until any given number, but then i only knew the very basics of python. i used chatgpt to get the required commands. i had a hard time putting the code together for each language but the internet had made it so easy for me. i realise that i cannot do anything more than this code, and i would be lucky if i can put it together without errors.
