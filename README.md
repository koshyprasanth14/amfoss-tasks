#amfoss tasks
I am Koshy Prasanth, S1 ECE student at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham.I had taken Biology and math in 12th, hence
i started coding just before one month, right after the onam holidays, when i decided to apply into amFOSS. 
Ive taken online classes and read many documentations of many languages, mainly python, and I find coding really 
interesting. I was always a lover of logical reasoning, critical thinking and problem solving skills. 

Im really excited about learning from experienced software developers, my seniors. After joining the amFOSS club, 
my primary goal is to absorb as much knowledge as possible and be immersed in a community of individuals who share 
my passion for technology. Im eager to contribute to the club in any way i can, be it assisting with research, 
event or project management, or other non coding tasks.

Thank you for considering my application, i look forward to grow alongside the members of this club and also 
to participate in the foss-bios night.
